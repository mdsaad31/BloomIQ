# üîÑ Keep Backend Alive - Complete Guide

## üìã Why This Is Needed

Render's free tier puts services to sleep after **15 minutes of inactivity**. When someone tries to access your backend after it's asleep, it takes **15-30 seconds** to wake up, causing a poor user experience.

**Solution:** Ping the backend every 10 minutes to keep it awake! ‚è∞

## ‚ö° Quick Start (Recommended Combo)

**Use both for maximum uptime:**

1. **GitHub Actions** - Primary keep-alive (always running)
2. **UptimeRobot** - Backup + monitoring + alerts

### **Setup Both:**

```bash
# 1. Push GitHub Actions workflow
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add keep-alive cron"
git push

# 2. Set up UptimeRobot (takes 2 minutes)
# Go to: https://uptimerobot.com
# Add monitor for: https://bloomiq.onrender.com/health
```

**Result:** Your backend will **never sleep** + you'll get alerts if anything goes wrong! üéâ

---

## üß™ Testing

### **Test Health Endpoint:**

```bash
# Using curl (Git Bash/WSL)
curl https://bloomiq.onrender.com/health

# Using PowerShell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://bloomiq.onrender.com/health"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "service": "BloomIQ Backend",
  "mongodb": "connected",
  "uptime": 1234.56
}
```

## üìä Monitoring Your Keep-Alive Service

### **GitHub Actions:**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/mdsaad31/BloomIQ/actions`
2. See all workflow runs
3. Green checkmark = success
4. Red X = failed (backend might be down)

### **Local Scripts (Node.js/Python/PowerShell):**
- Watch console for logs
- Look for ‚úÖ green checkmarks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è yellow warnings = timeout (normal on cold start)
- ‚ùå red errors = backend might be down

### **UptimeRobot:**
- Dashboard shows uptime percentage
- Graph shows response times
- Get email/SMS alerts on downtime

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **GitHub Actions Not Running:**

1. Check if workflow file is in correct location:
   ```
   .github/workflows/keep-backend-alive.yml
   ```

2. Verify it's pushed to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -1
   # Should show commit with "keep-alive"
   ```

3. Check Actions tab on GitHub:
   - Must have Actions enabled in repository settings
   - Go to: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Allow all actions

### **Local Script Stops Working:**

- **Node.js/Python:** Process was killed
  - **Solution:** Run in background or use PM2
  
  ```bash
  # Install PM2 (process manager)
  npm install -g pm2
  
  # Run with PM2
  pm2 start keep-alive.js --name bloomiq-keepalive
  
  # Check status
  pm2 status
  
  # View logs
  pm2 logs
  
  # Stop
  pm2 stop bloomiq-keepalive
  ```

### **Backend Still Sleeping:**

If you see slow response times:

1. **Reduce ping interval** in scripts (from 10 to 5 minutes)
2. **Use multiple services** (GitHub Actions + UptimeRobot)
3. **Upgrade Render plan** (paid plans don't sleep)
