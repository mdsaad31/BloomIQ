## 🧪 Testing

### 1. Health Check

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 2. Test Workflow (Recommended First!)

```powershell
# Test with a URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test-workflow `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{\"url\": \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490750967868-88aa4486c946?w=800\"}'
```

This shows you the raw Roboflow response!

### 3. Full Prediction

```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict `
  -F "file=@path\to\your\image.jpg"
```

## 🔧 Understanding Your Workflow

### Run the Test Script

```powershell
python test_roboflow.py
```

Look at the output - it will show you:
1. ✅ Connection status
2. 📊 Raw result structure
3. 🔍 Result type and keys
4. 💡 Tips for parsing

### Common Response Structures

**Format 1: Output with predictions**
```python
[
  {
    "output": {
      "predictions": [
        {"class": "flower", "confidence": 0.89, ...}
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

**Format 2: Top-level predictions**
```python
[
  {
    "predictions": [
      {"class": "flower", "confidence": 0.89, ...}
    ]
  }
]
```

The updated service handles both! 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "inference_sdk not installed"

```powershell
pip install inference-sdk
```

### Issue: "Client not initialized"

Check your `.env` file:
```powershell
cd backend
Get-Content .env | Select-String "ROBOFLOW"
```

Should show:
```
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=nRWwVHvuqJPkPtV2WZoB
ROBOFLOW_WORKSPACE=moh-s15o3
ROBOFLOW_WORKFLOW_ID=custom-workflow
```

### Issue: "Workflow not found"

1. Check Roboflow dashboard
2. Verify workflow is published
3. Test with `python test_roboflow.py`

### Issue: Getting 200 but no predictions

**This is normal if:**
- Image doesn't contain flowers/fruits
- Workflow needs different input format
- Class names don't match

**Solutions:**
1. Run `python test_roboflow.py` to see raw output
2. Check the logs for "Raw Roboflow Result"
3. Update class name matching if needed
4. Test with images you know have flowers/fruits

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{\"url\": \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490750967868-88aa4486c946?w=800\"}'
```

### 3. Check the Logs

Look for:
- ✅ "Roboflow client initialized successfully"
- 📊 "Raw Roboflow Result" section
- 🎯 Detection counts
- ❌ Any errors

### 4. Test with Backend

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
node server.js

# Terminal 2: ML Service
cd backend\python-service
python roboflow_service.py

# Terminal 3: Make request
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/analysis/analyze `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" `
  -F "file=@image.jpg"
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always run `test_roboflow.py` first** - It shows you exactly what your workflow returns

2. **Check the logs** - They're very detailed now and will help you debug

3. **Use `/test-workflow` endpoint** - Faster than full prediction, shows raw results

4. **Look at `raw_result` in response** - It contains the unprocessed Roboflow output

5. **Test with known images** - Use images with obvious flowers/fruits for testing
