## 🧪 What to Do Next

### Option A: Test with Android Studio Emulator

**You'll need to:**
1. **Install Android Studio** (if not installed)
   - Download: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Takes ~15-20 minutes

2. **Create Virtual Device**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Device Manager → Create Device
   - Choose Pixel 5 / API 33

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

### Option B: Test with Physical Android Device (Faster!)

**Steps:**
1. **Enable Developer Mode on your phone**
   - Settings → About Phone → Tap "Build Number" 7 times

2. **Enable USB Debugging**
   - Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging ON

3. **Connect via USB**
   - Plug in your phone
   - Allow USB debugging prompt

4. **Update API URL for your network**
   ```bash
   # In mobile/.env
   # Replace with your computer's local IP (run ipconfig to find it)
   API_URL=http://YOUR_IP_HERE:5000/api
   ```

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

### Option C: Quick Preview (No Device Needed Yet)

**Just verify the code compiles:**
```bash
# Metro is already running ✅
# App should show "Welcome to Metro!"
```
