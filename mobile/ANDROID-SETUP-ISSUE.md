# üîß React Native Android Setup Required

## Issue: Android Project Not Found

Your React Native project is missing the native Android files. This is normal for a new React Native project that hasn't been initialized yet.

## üéØ Solution: 2 Options

### Option 1: Use Expo (Recommended - Easiest) ‚ö°

Expo makes React Native development much easier without needing Android Studio or native setup.

#### Step 1: Convert to Expo
```bash
cd mobile

# Install Expo
npx expo install

# OR create new Expo project and copy files
cd ..
npx create-expo-app@latest mobile-expo --template blank-typescript
```

#### Step 2: Copy your code
```bash
# Copy screens, components, services to new expo project
# Update imports if needed
```

#### Step 3: Run with Expo
```bash
cd mobile-expo
npx expo start

# Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone!
```

### Option 2: Initialize Native React Native (Complex)

This requires full Android Studio setup and takes longer.

#### Step 1: Prerequisites
1. ‚úÖ Install Android Studio
2. ‚úÖ Install JDK 11 or 17
3. ‚úÖ Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
4. ‚úÖ Add Android SDK to PATH

#### Step 2: Initialize Android Project
```bash
cd mobile

# Initialize React Native with template
npx react-native init BloomIQMobile --template react-native-template-typescript

# This will create android/ and ios/ folders
```

#### Step 3: Copy Your Code
```bash
# Copy from your current mobile folder to the new BloomIQMobile folder:
# - src/
# - package.json dependencies
# - .env
# - tsconfig.json
```

#### Step 4: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd BloomIQMobile
npm install
```

#### Step 5: Run
```bash
npm run android
```

## üöÄ Recommended Path: Expo

Since you want to test quickly without Android Studio complexity, let me help you set up with Expo:

### Why Expo?
‚úÖ No Android Studio needed
‚úÖ Test on your phone in 2 minutes
‚úÖ Scan QR code to run
‚úÖ Hot reload just works
‚úÖ Easier development

### What You Lose
‚ùå Can't use some native modules (but you don't need them)
‚ùå Larger app size (but fine for testing)

## üéØ Quick Fix: Let's Use Expo!

Run these commands:

```bash
# 1. Go to parent directory
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Hackathons\chip-to-crop\BloomIQ-v4

# 2. Create new Expo project
npx create-expo-app@latest mobile-expo --template blank-typescript

# 3. Stop Metro bundler (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)

# 4. I'll help you copy the files over
```

Would you like me to:
1. **Create Expo project** (easiest, 2 mins to test)
2. **Initialize native React Native** (requires Android Studio, 30+ mins)
3. **Show me how to test web version first** (already working)

Let me know which option you prefer! üöÄ
