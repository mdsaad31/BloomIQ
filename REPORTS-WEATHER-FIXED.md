# üîß Reports & Weather Fixed!

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Reports API Response Mismatch**

**Problem:** 
- Backend returns `{ reports: [...] }` 
- Mobile app expected direct array in `response.data`

**Solution:**
- Updated mobile app to handle both formats: `response.data.reports || response.data`
- Updated backend to return ALL necessary fields for each report

**Files Changed:**
- `mobile-expo/src/screens/ReportsScreen.tsx` - Added proper response handling
- `backend/routes/reports.js` - Enhanced response with all fields

**Backend Response Structure:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  reports: [
    {
      _id: "...",
      imageUrl: "...",
      originalFilename: "...",
      stage: "flowering/fruiting",
      overallStage: "...",
      confidence: 95.5,
      detections: 10,
      classCounts: { "fully_ripened": 3, "half_ripened": 5 },
      all_detections: [...],  // Array of detection objects
      yieldKg: 2.5,
      estimatedEarnings: 250,
      marketPricePerKg: 100,
      recommendations: ["..."],
      createdAt: "2025-10-15...",
      analysisDate: "2025-10-15..."
    }
  ],
  total: 10,
  page: 1,
  pages: 1
}
```

### 2. **Weather API Endpoint Mismatch**

**Problem:** 
- Backend had only `/api/weather/current` endpoint
- Mobile app calling `/api/weather?city=...`

**Solution:**
- Added main `/` route to weather router
- Returns full forecast data with 3-day prediction
- Handles mock data when API key not configured
- Supports both city name and lat/lon queries

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/routes/weather.js` - Added main weather endpoint

**Weather Response Structure:**
```javascript
{
  location: {
    name: "Delhi",
    region: "Delhi",
    country: "India"
  },
  current: {
    temp_c: 22,
    temp_f: 72,
    condition: {
      text: "Partly cloudy",
      icon: "//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/116.png"
    },
    humidity: 65,
    wind_kph: 15,
    wind_mph: 9,
    feelslike_c: 22,
    feelslike_f: 72,
    uv: 5,
    precip_mm: 0,
    cloud: 30
  },
  forecast: {
    forecastday: [
      {
        date: "2025-10-15",
        day: {
          maxtemp_c: 25,
          mintemp_c: 18,
          avgtemp_c: 22,
          condition: { text: "Partly cloudy" },
          daily_chance_of_rain: 30
        }
      }
      // ... 2 more days
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. **Report Field Name Mismatch**

**Problem:**
- Database model uses `allDetections` (camelCase)
- Mobile app expects `all_detections` (snake_case)

**Solution:**
- Backend now maps `allDetections` ‚Üí `all_detections` in response
- All field names now match mobile app expectations

## üß™ Testing

### Test Reports:
1. **Login to the app**
2. **Go to Reports tab**
3. **Should see:**
   - List of all analysis reports
   - Report cards with image thumbnails
   - Stage indicators (flowering/fruiting)
   - Confidence percentages
   - Expand/collapse functionality
   - Class distribution breakdown
   - Detection details
   - Delete functionality

### Test Weather:
1. **Go to Weather tab**
2. **Default city loads** (Delhi)
3. **Should see:**
   - Current temperature
   - Weather condition with description
   - Humidity, wind speed, feels like temp, UV index
   - 3-day forecast
   - Crop care recommendations (based on weather)

4. **Search for other cities:**
   - Type city name (e.g., "Mumbai", "London", "New York")
   - Press Search
   - Weather data updates

## üîç Debugging Tips

### If Reports Still Not Loading:

1. **Check API Response:**
```typescript
// In ReportsScreen.tsx
console.log('Response data:', response?.data);
```

2. **Check Backend Logs:**
```
Look for "Get reports error" in terminal
```

3. **Check Auth Token:**
```
Make sure you're logged in
Token should be in SecureStore
```

4. **Test Backend Directly:**
```bash
# Get your auth token first by logging in
curl http://172.17.106.8:5000/api/reports \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### If Weather Not Loading:

1. **Check API Key:**
```javascript
// In backend/.env
WEATHER_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
```

2. **Test Weather Endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://172.17.106.8:5000/api/weather?city=Delhi \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

3. **Check Console Logs:**
```
Look for "Weather API error" in backend terminal
```
